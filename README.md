# NTU Blockchain Capstone Projects 2025

Three distinct blockchain capstone projects for the SightAI platform ecosystem, each focusing on different aspects of decentralized AI service platforms.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Enhanced-AI-App-Platform
**Focus:** Authorization & Usage Control

A blockchain-based trust layer for AI application platforms that enables users to safely authorize third-party apps to use their AI credits with transparent usage limits and scope management.

**Key Challenge:** Design a scope management system supporting both model family-level access (e.g., "GPT-4 family") and specific model access (e.g., "gpt-4-turbo").

- **Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐ Medium
- **Duration:** 8 weeks
- **Team Size:** 1-2 students

### 2. Multi-Model-Routing-System
**Focus:** Model Registry & Routing

A decentralized model registry and routing audit system that creates transparency and accountability in AI model selection through blockchain-based reputation and performance tracking.

**Key Features:** Model registration, routing audit trails, performance oracles, and reputation scoring.

- **Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Medium-Hard
- **Duration:** 8 weeks
- **Team Size:** 1-2 students
- [View Project Details →](./Multi-Model-Routing-System/)

### 3. Trustless-Audit-System
**Focus:** Multi-Modal Settlement

A blockchain settlement layer for high-value AI services (text, image, video) that provides transparent settlement, dispute resolution, and automated payment distribution.

**Key Features:** Multi-modal settlement tracking, pricing oracles, dispute resolution, and trustless payment claims.

- **Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hard
- **Duration:** 8 weeks
- **Team Size:** 2 students (recommended)
